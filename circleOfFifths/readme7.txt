To run this program, the .xcodeproj file must be opened in the latest version of Xcode and run with the iPhone 6.0 Simulator.

There does not need to be any extra sound packages installed.

To generate a dodecahedron scale, just press the dode scale button.

On the console, the final scale will be printed.

To play the notes, go to the ViewController.m file, and scroll down to the playDodeScale method all the way at the bottom.  Where it's commented out, uncomment the code.  Re-compile and run the code and press the dode scale button again to play.
